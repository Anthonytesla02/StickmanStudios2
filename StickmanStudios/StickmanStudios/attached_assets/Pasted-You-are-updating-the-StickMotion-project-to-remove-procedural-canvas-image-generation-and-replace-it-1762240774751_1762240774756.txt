You are updating the StickMotion project to remove procedural canvas image generation and replace it with Gemini-based stickman image generation.

**Goal:** Make StickMotion generate clean, high-quality stickman-style images (like a comic panel) directly using the Gemini API, instead of Node Canvas drawings with long text captions.

**Changes required:**

1. **Remove Canvas Drawing**
   - Delete or disable all Node Canvas logic in `server/services/imageGenerator.ts`.
   - Remove `import { createCanvas } from "canvas"` and related drawing code.

2. **Add Gemini Image Generation**
   - Import and initialize the Gemini client:
     ```typescript
     import { GoogleGenerativeAI } from "@google/genai";
     const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(process.env.GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY!);
     ```
   - Replace the old procedural image generation with this new async function:
     ```typescript
     export async function generateImage(scenePrompt: string, index: number) {
       const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-2.0-pro-vision" });

       const imagePrompt = `
       Create a clean, high-quality stickman comic panel illustration.
       - White background
       - Minimalist, thin black outlines
       - Subtle colors for eyes (blue, green, brown)
       - Include short text labels if relevant (e.g. "GREEN", "BROWN")
       - Avoid long captions or bottom text
       - Style: educational infographic / simple comic
       Scene: ${scenePrompt}
       `;

       const result = await model.generateImage(imagePrompt);
       const buffer = Buffer.from(result.data, "base64");
       fs.writeFileSync(\`temp_video/frame_\${index}.png\`, buffer);
     }
     ```

3. **Update Gemini Scene Prompt**
   - In `server/services/gemini.ts`, replace the old prompt that asks for detailed descriptions with this shorter one:
     ```typescript
     const prompt = `
     Generate a concise visual concept for a stickman animation scene.
     Respond with a short phrase (max 10 words) that describes what should happen visually.
     Example outputs:
     - "Stickman with brown eyes shading from bright sun"
     - "Stickman labeled GREEN pointing at DNA chain"
     `;
     ```
   - Return only this short phrase to `imageGenerator.ts` (no long descriptive paragraphs).

4. **Confirm Video Assembly**
   - Ensure FFmpeg still processes `.png` frames in `temp_video/` as before — no other pipeline changes are needed.

5. **Dependencies**
   - Remove the `canvas` dependency from `package.json`.
   - Ensure `@google/genai` is installed and up to date.

**Expected Result:**
- Each script line produces a single image that looks like a professional stickman infographic (white background, minimal text, clean art).
- The video assembles with these Gemini-generated PNGs instead of Canvas-drawn frames.

Once done, test the flow by generating a 3–4 line script to verify that:
- No captions appear at the bottom.
- Each image is visually stylized like a clean educational comic.
